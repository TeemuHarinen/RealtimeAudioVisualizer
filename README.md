# RealtimeAudioVisualizer
Real time audio visualizer created with numpy and pyaudio. Creates an audio visualizer from audio inputstream specified by the index (run findSourceIndex.py to find out device indexes) and uses the terminal as the screen.

Proof of concept for future Stream Deck audio visualizer plugin.
